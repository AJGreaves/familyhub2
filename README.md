# Family Hub 2

An English language web application for family evenings and activities for kids in the the Haarlemmermeer area of The Netherlands. 

Application based on a previous [student project I built](https://github.com/AJGreaves/familyhub) using Flask and MongoDB. Updated to use Django3 and SQL.
